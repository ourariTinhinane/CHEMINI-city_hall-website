# CHEMINI-city_hall-website
This project represents the end of my first-cycle preparatory studies project at the High School of Computer Science in Béjaïa, Algeria. The primary objective was to design and develop a comprehensive website dedicated to one of the city halls in Béjaïa, which is a wilaya (province) of Algeria.

Project Features:

Information Hub: Our website serves as an informative gateway to the city hall, providing visitors with essential details and insights about its functions and services.

Service Accessibility: Users can access a dedicated section for each service offered by the city hall. This section not only describes the services but also allows visitors to schedule appointments and submit service requests online, streamlining administrative processes.

Current Affairs: Stay up-to-date with the latest news and events related to the city hall through our "Current Affairs" section. It offers real-time updates on important developments.

History and Tourism: Explore the rich history and tourism attractions of the city through our dedicated section, showcasing the cultural heritage and beauty of the region.
