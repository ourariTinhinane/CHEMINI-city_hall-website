# CHEMINI-city_hall-website
This project represents the end of my first-cycle preparatory studies project at the High School of Computer Science in Béjaïa, Algeria. The primary objective was to design and develop a comprehensive website dedicated to one of the city halls in Béjaïa, which is a wilaya (province) of Algeria.
